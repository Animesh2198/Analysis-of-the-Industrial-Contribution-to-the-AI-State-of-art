# Analysis-of-the-Industrial-Contribution-to-the-AI-State-of-art

Description
Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving rapidly, reshaping various facets of human life. This Git repository encompasses code and documentation for conducting systematic bibliometric analysis, aiming to gain comprehensive insights into the AI landscape. The primary focus is on scholarly articles, their metadata, and the utilization of various techniques for trend analysis.

Background
The landscape overview explains the swift evolution of AI, prompting a surge in literature contributions. The main objective is to conduct bibliometric analysis to discern trends, patterns, and key contributors in the field.

Data Acquisition: The repository employs web crawling to extract bibliographic information from scholarly articles, forming the basis for analysis.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques such as regex, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and other NLP methods are used to process and prepare textual data for analysis.

Clustering: Clustering techniques are applied to organize and categorize data for a clearer understanding.

Literature Review: A summary of the literature review provides insights into trends across industries, web scraping methods, and significant findings.

Methodology
The methodology section outlines the step-by-step process for conducting bibliometric analysis.

Data Acquisition: Details the use of the Digital Bibliography and Library Project (DBLP) and the Scrappy Spider tool for data retrieval.

Scrappy Spider: Data Flow: Illustrates how data flows through the Scrappy Spider tool.

Data Preparation: Describes the classification of conferences and affiliations, providing insights into how the dataset is prepared for analysis.

Topic Modeling - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): Highlights the application of LDA for identifying latent topics within the dataset.

Visualization with Python: Discusses the use of Python for visualizing the analyzed data.

LDA Visualization: Explores the components and visualization techniques applied to LDA results.

Experimentation
The experimentation section presents the experiments conducted to analyze trends, contributions, and themes in AI literature.

Trends in Academic-Industry Contributions: Describes experiments related to the evolution and impact of AI conferences, academic and industry contributions, and more.

Exploration of Leading Contributions: Covers experiments related to pioneering contributions from academic institutions and industries.

Understanding Global Contributions: Details experiments related to global contributions of countries and influential papers through citation analysis.

Exploration of Latent Themes: Describes experiments related to the implementation of LDA for discovering latent themes in AI literature.
